Concept Map: init, add, staging area

We’ve introduced a few new concepts since we last revisited our concept map.

git add
git status

Remember our concept map from last lesson? Here’s what it looked like the last time we added a new concept.

Where Do the New Concepts Go?

Here’s the structure we’ve come up with for how to add these new concepts in to the map. Which concept belongs where?

Concept Map with blanks

In the following quiz, write in the concept that you think belongs in each new empty node.

Reflect: Staging Area

Now that you’ve added a file to the staging area (or maybe multiple files!), go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your lesson_2_reflections file:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

When you've updated your document, click "Next" and Caroline will go over how to commit the changes you’ve added to the staging area.

How to write a commit message

You're about to make your first commit to your reflections repository. When you do this, you'll need to write a commit message describing your changes. If you followed the instructions in the "Setting Up Your Workspace" video for your platform near the end of Lesson 1, the editor you chose will appear as soon as you run git commit and allow you to write a commit message. If you get an error message, you should try revisiting the instructions in Lesson 1 and make sure your text editor is set up properly.

You can also specify a commit message via the command line by running git commit -m "Commit message" instead of just git commit. It's still a good idea to get an editor set up, since this will make it easier to write long commit messages that fully describe the change.

Commit message style

While commit message style varies from person to person, this style guide describes some common best practices when writing commit messages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leave 'detached HEAD' state

Right now, your HEAD should still be 'detached' from Lesson 1 when you checked out an old commit. To fix that, run the command git checkout master. You'll learn more about what this command does later this lesson.

Fix the delay bug

Now, if you were following along with Caroline, you may have already fixed the bug in the Asteroids repository. If not, go ahead and make the change and add it to the staging area now.

In game.js find the statement if (this.delayBeforeBullet <= 0) { (should be on line 423). On the next line, insert this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;

Stage your change

Then stage your change by adding the game.js file to the staging area. If you’re having trouble remembering how to stage changes, use this video as a refresher.

Commit your change

Now, go ahead and commit this change. Make sure to use a meaningful commit message! If you have trouble remember how to commit, refer to this video.

When you’re finished committing your change, click “Next”.
